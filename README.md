## React Concepts Used

 1. **Components:**
 - Functional components are used for rendering UI elements like the Navbar, Footer, and Product Cards.

2. **Props:**
- Props are used to pass data between components, such as passing product details to the ProductCard component.

3. **State Management:**
- Local state is used in components like modals to control visibility, while global state for cart and wishlist is managed using Context API.

4. **useEffect:**
- Used for performing side effects such as fetching product data from a mock API or saving to LocalStorage when the cart or wishlist changes.

5. **useContext:**
- Provides access to the global cart and wishlist state across the application.

## Key Features of the project:

1. **Responsive Design:**
- The site is mobile-first and looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

2. **Categories Sidebar:**
- Gadgets are grouped by categories like Computers, Phones, Smart Watches, Chargers, and Power Banks. Users can easily filter products by categories.

3. **Product Filtering & Sorting:**
- Users can filter products by categories and sort them by price in ascending or descending order.

4. **Interactive Product Cards:**
- Each product is displayed as a card with an image, name, price, and a "Details" button to view more information about the product.

5. **Add to Cart and Wishlist:**
- Users can add items to the cart and wishlist. The cart shows the total price, and items can be removed from both the cart and wishlist.

## Data Management
1. **Context API:**
- The Context API is used to manage the global state of the cart and wishlist. The state is provided by a Context Provider component and consumed by the necessary components using useContext.

2. **LocalStorage:**
- Cart and wishlist data are saved in LocalStorage to persist user selections even after page reloads. When the app is reloaded, the data is fetched from LocalStorage to maintain consistency.
